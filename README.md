# ETL Pipeline with Logging

This project implements a simple **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** pipeline in Python, organized using classes and featuring a built-in logging mechanism. It demonstrates how to:

* **Extract** data from multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, XML).
* **Transform** raw measurements (e.g., height in inches → meters, weight in pounds → kilograms).
* **Load** the cleaned data into a single output CSV.
* **Log** progress and phases to a timestamped log file.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+**
* **Pandas**
* No additional libraries (only Python standard library for XML and datetime)

Install Pandas if you haven’t already:

```bash
   pip install pandas
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/20krish20/ETL_For_Beginners.git
   ```

2. **Place your source files**
   - Put any `.csv`, `.json`, or `.xml` files in the root or in a `data/` folder.

3. **Run the pipeline**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

This will:

* Extract from all matching files
* Transform heights (inches → meters) and weights (lbs → kg)
* Load the result into `transformed_data.csv`
* Append log entries to `log_file.txt`

## 📊 Logging

The `Logger` class writes phase markers and timestamps to `log_file.txt`, for example:

```
2025-05-17 14:30:02, ETL Job Started
2025-05-17 14:30:02, Extract phase Started
2025-05-17 14:30:03, Extract phase Ended
2025-05-17 14:30:03, Transform phase Started
...
2025-05-17 14:30:04, ETL Job Ended
```

Use these logs to audit performance and troubleshoot issues.

## 🔄 Customization

* **Target filename:** Change the default in `ETL(target_file=...)` constructor.
* **Unit conversions:** Modify the `transform()` method in `etl_code.py`.
* **Additional formats:** Add new `extract_from_*` methods in `ETL`.
